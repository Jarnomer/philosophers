## 📝 General

Goal of the project is to explore [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) in multithreaded environment.

For each philosophers, there is `equal` amount of `forks` and they need `two` forks to begin the meal.

Eating takes a set duration in `milliseconds`. Then they `sleep` and finally commence `thinking` again.

Philosopher will die if it can't `begin` a meal within time to die since `taking forks`.

Dining will `end` if any of the philosophers is `death` or everyone has `eaten` the set amount of `meals`.

## 🛠️ Build

GNU `make` and `gcc` are required to build and compile the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jarnomer/philosophers.git
```

```bash
cd philosophers && make all
```

## ⚡ Usage

`Philosophers` are expecting these values and last one is optional.

| Value | Description            |
|-------|------------------------|
| 2     | Number of philosophers |
| 600   | Time to die (ms)       |
| 300   | Time to eat (ms)       |
| 200   | Time to sleep (ms)     |
| 4     | Number of meals (optional)       |

If `meals count` is not provided and `time to die` is long enough, the simulation will run infinitely.

```bash
./philo 2 610 300 200 3
```

```bash
./philo 2 610 300 200
```

Every `event` is printed to `STDOUT`. Here is an example where philosopher dies. 

```bash
./philo 2 500 300 200
```

```bash
0 2 is thinking
0 1 has taken fork
0 1 has taken fork
0 1 is eating
301 1 is sleeping
301 2 has taken fork
301 2 has taken fork
301 2 is eating
501 1 died
```

Incorrect input results to `Error`.

```bash
./philo 2 500 300 200 abc
```

```bash
Error: abc: Is invalid argument
```

## 🚀 Details

After initialization the `process manager` is responsible for managing `threads` and `mutexes`.

To help this and overall process, `operater` functions are used as wrappers.

```c
operate_thread(&data->monitor, OP_DETACH, data, NULL);
```

```c
operate_mutex(&data->mutex[i++], OP_INIT, data);
```

Lastly the `monitor` thread is created to overview the dining `routine`.

```c
void *run_monitor(void *param)
{
  t_data *data;
  long   current_time;

  data = (t_data *)param;
  threads_spinlocked(data);
  while (true)
  {
    if (process_finished(data) || process_failed(data))
      break ;
    current_time = get_runtime(data);
    if (philosopher_death(data, current_time) || philosophers_full(data))
      set_finished(data);
    usleep(500);
  }
  return (NULL);
}
```

Since `usleep` is not natively precise enough, custom `precision_sleep` is used instead.

```c
void precise_sleep(int target_time, t_data *data)
{
  long start;
  long current;

  start = operate_timer(OP_MSEC, data);
  while (true)
  {
    current = operate_timer(OP_MSEC, data);
    if (current - start >= target_time)
      break ;
    usleep(500);
  }
}
```

Main `data` and `each` philosopher have `enumerated` boolean statuses and their corresponding mutexes.

```c
typedef struct s_data
{
  [...]
  t_mtx   mutex[MTX_COUNT_DATA];
  bool    stat[STT_COUNT_DATA];
} t_data;
```

These are used by `getset` functions and `synchro` utilities to view and change process states.

```c
void threads_synchronized(t_data *data)
{
  set_status(&data->stat[ST_SYNC], true, &data->mutex[MX_SYNC], data);
}
```

```c
void threads_spinlocked(t_data *data)
{
  while (!get_status(&data->stat[ST_SYNC], &data->mutex[MX_SYNC], data))
    true ;
}
```
